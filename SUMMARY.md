# Fix Summary: PNG Import/Export Color Fidelity Issues

## Quick Overview

Fixed two critical bugs in the PNG import/export feature where:
1. Gaps between sub-regions were incorrectly filled with parent region colors
2. Black/unmapped regions were incorrectly colored during export

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Gap Coloring (Position 608, 96)
- **Before**: #efefef (wrong - from parent region dominant color)
- **After**: #000000 (correct - gap remains unmapped/black)

### Issue #2: Black Region Coloring (Position 576, 960)
- **Before**: #e41ae3 (wrong - from region's non-black pixels)
- **After**: #000000 (correct - preserved as black)

## Key Changes

1. **Import**: Changed from "dominant color across entire region" to "exact pixel at region start"
2. **Import**: Skip regions where input pixel is black (#000000)
3. **Export**: Skip parent regions (only fill leaf regions)
4. **Export**: Skip empty and black color regions

## Testing

✅ All existing tests pass
✅ New integration tests confirm both issues are fixed
✅ Control regions with actual colors work correctly

## Files Changed

- `palette_editor.py`: Core import/export logic
- `test_import_export_fix.py`: Unit tests
- `test_e2e_import_export.py`: Integration tests
- `PNG_IMPORT_EXPORT_FIX.md`: Detailed documentation

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Fully backward compatible
✅ Existing configuration files work unchanged
✅ All existing functionality preserved
